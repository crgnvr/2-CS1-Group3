1. What is the difference between Commit and push?
- A COMMIT represents a saved snapshot of the project at a specific point in time, and it includes various information like the author, date and even a message that describes the changes. While PUSH sends commit to a remote repository.

2. Why are branches important?
- BRANCHES are important because it let the developers work safely and independently without affecting the main code. And multiple developers can work on different features at the same time without interfering with each other.

3. What cause merge conflicts??
- it can happen when Git can't automatically combine changes from different branches. Also, when two branches modify the same line in a file in different ways, or sometimes Git doesn't know whether to keep or remove the file.
